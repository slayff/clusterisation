# clustering
simple cpp code implementing MST and K-Means <s>clusterisation</s> clustering algorithms

Folders contains the following data:
* plot_base - raw data of generated points
* plot_initial - correct (as generated) clusters
* plot_mst - data computed by Kruskal's MST algorithm
* plot_kmeans - data computed by K-Means algorithm

Each folder contains script.txt file, used by gnuplot to create plots

Usage: `gnuplot script.txt -p`
